# Comparison and Optimization of Cellular Neighbor Preference (NEP) Methods for Quantitative Tissue Analysis
Author: Chiara Schiller

## Introduction
Studying the spatial distribution of cell types in tissues is essential for understanding their function in health and disease. A widely used spatial feature for quantifying tissue organization is the pairwise neighbor preference (NEP) of cell types, also termed co-occurrence or colocalization. Various methods to infer NEPs have proved their utility in numerous biological studies, but despite their broad usage in the spatial biology community, no clear guidelines exist for selecting one method over the other. In this github repository, we study the methods on two aspects: (1) their discriminatory power to distinguish different tissue architectures and (2) their ability to recover the directionality of NEPs. We conducted method performance comparison with in silico tissue simulated data and showcased its biological applicability to a myocardial infarction dataset studying immune cell infiltration. The method results used in this github repository can be generated with the linked method specific github repositories.

## This repository
We systematically compared the NEP methods Giotto, IMCRtools (classic and histoCAT), MISTy, SEA, Squidpy, Scimap and our newly proposed method COZI. In this repo, we load the NEP results of different tissue organization cohorts (repo: IST_generation) and perform binary classification between two cohorts with differing tissue organization parameters. We perfom the classification with a random forest classifier. Further, we evaluate the distinction performance with the F1 score and the cosine similarity between the feature importances and ground-truth cell-cell adjacency vectors. We further explore the NEP methods on a myocardial infarction dataset

## Repo structure
notebook: 
- Comparison_SCNA.Rmd: Contains the code for loading all SCNA result files formatted in a sample by interaction feature .csv file 2 folders up to this github repository.
- Comparison_celltype_abundances.Rmd: Perfoms comparison not based on SCNA but on cell type abundance difference between simulated cohorts

SCNA_exploration:
- Comparison_SCNA_preferencediff.Rmd: Compare SCNA results across different cell type abundance groups and not based on different cell-cell adjacencies
- interactionscore_distribution.Rmd: Exploration of the differences between interaction scores of histoCAT and SEA


## How to run this
Please clone this github repository. Input data are. csv files of SCNA results generated by one of the SCNA repos in this githubgroup or by your own analysis. The structure of the SCNA results are samples (rows) by interaction scores (columns). The data folder can be specified at the beginning of the script. 

The naming convention of the samples is crucial for comparison and would need to be adapted for other comparisons.
Our naming of samples was: 

"cross01_0.45_ab0_0.05_13.csv"

Translation: 

"preference_preferencestrength_abundancecelltype_abundance_samplenumber.csv"

The script performs comparison between different prefernces and abundance groups depending on this sample naming convention.
